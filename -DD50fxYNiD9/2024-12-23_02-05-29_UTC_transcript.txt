 This man right here, if his inventions were taken seriously, the world would be in a completely different place today. Viktor Schauburger, born in the 1800s, had a strong fascination with water, forests, and the natural world. Through his years, he postulated that water is self-organizing and actually conscious. He thought that modern-day science was mechanistic and materialistic and didn't take into account energies, frequencies, vibration, like Nikola Tesla, and spirituality. One of his inventions was a water-structuring device. And if we use these today, we wouldn't have to use chlorine and other strange chemicals they add to the water to clean it. With his invention, it cleans water by structuring it molecularly. He referred to this as living water. He invented water turbines that generated electricity from water without pressure or heat. He also used copper coils to harness water's electrical potential. As it implodes, there's a little electrical current you can basically use to harness it. Kind of sounds like free energy. He made implosion motors, engines that ran on water, or air power without combustion or explosion. And he also made literal flying saucers, at least according to his studies, science, research, and the things that came out from it. He used electrical coils to ionize air molecules and create a plasma field around the hull of this basically UFO. Unfortunately, he was offered a deal to go to Texas, to get a bunch of money to help improve his work and develop his work and to being used around the world. And unfortunately, he signed a deceptive contract which signed away his life work to an element of the US military. And he perished shortly after.
